# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
  If you look at my 2nd assignment, you can see that my examples should be from different age groups. 
  I think I can fill out the survey successfully if I have enough examples for each group. 
  Sufficient number of people from each age group (e.g. 50 people for each age group) 
  I think it is enough to represent the target audience.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
Talking about errors (Sampling errors, Non-sampling errors, coverage errors, coverage bias or measurement errors), 
I don't think I would have such errors if I classified all my samples by age.

Depending on the purpose of the survey, there are many different ways to define and assess quality
Survey has to be relevant, and must be close to the true population quantitative, data and results must be accessible, 
and common definitions and standards should be used when data comes from different sources.

Questions;
They must be simple and clear, avoid leading questions, think about open vs. closed questions, 
and have no double negatives.

In light of the above information, 
I wouldn't change any of the first 5 questions of my survey, but;
I wouldn't put any age limit for question 6,
I would combine 7-8 questions into one question,
It would be more descriptive to specify options for the 10th question.
By implementing these changes, the survey could have been more inclusive, open, 
and capable of capturing different musical preferences and experiences over time.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
   I do not believe that an observational survey would be successful. 
   Because my survey is about people's experiences it is very difficult for me to see these experiences by observing. 
   I can learn about people's current music tastes by observing them, 
   but I need their experiences with music tastes that change over time.
    ```

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
