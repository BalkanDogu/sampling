# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: "3"

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
write your answer here...

A survey to find out the class of music we listen to and the connection between music and age. 
A study shows how music taste changes according to age. 
Understand how musical preferences change with age.

```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
write your answer here...

My target population can be various age groups (15-25, 25-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61+), 
for example all people between the ages of 15-60.
Because people's musical tastes generally begin to develop during adolescence.

Samplig Frame:

- High schools and universities where I will meet with 15-25 age groups and get information from them.
- Workplaces, concert venues, social media groups, and music club members where 
I can talk to people in the 25-60 age group.
- Parks, casinos, event areas for retirees and retirement homes for people over 60.

Sampling Units :

Every person I can talk to and get information from in workplaces, 
concert halls, social media groups and music clubs.

* Sampling Units and Observational Units I think are almost the same groups.

Sampling strategy 

The sampling strategy I will be using is Stratified Random Sampling (SRS). Using a Stratified Random Sampling I would divide 
the population into strata (subgroups) based on age groups (15-25, 25-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61+)  to ensure representation across 
different age categories. Then, random sampling within each stratum I would be performed.

Justification :

-Using different data collection methods can help capture different music preferences by reaching a wider and more diverse audience.
- A well-calculated sample size and appropriate sampling method increase the accuracy and precision of the survey results, reducing 
sampling bias and error.
- Stratified sampling ensures that different age groups are proportionally represented and allows for accurate analysis.
